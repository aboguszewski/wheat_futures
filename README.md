## Wheat Future Price Forecasting
This repository showcases exploration and feature engineering using real world weather, macroeconomic, international trade and futures market datasets.  

### Data Download
Due to the large size of the datasets I uploaded them to Kaggle.  
They can be found [*here*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aboguszewski/wheat-futures-forecasting/data) and should be placed in a separate `data` directory.
